Our Mission
Serving the Midwest with integrity, while maintaining the speed and reliability you deserve.

Foundations
Allen-Hope & Associates, previously known as Dennis Allen Process Serving, was established in 1972 by late Dennis Allen.  Scott Hope began working for Dennis in 1987 as a process server and eventually worked his way up to a Court Officer/Deputy Sheriff.  Scott met Dennisâ€™s daughter Charissa and a few years later they married.  In 2004, after the passing of Dennis, Scott Hope continued the legacy and Allen-Hope & Associates was formed.  

A New Beginning
In 2022 after almost 20 years under Allen-Hope & Associates, the Hope administration decided to rebrand into Great Lakes Civil Services. The purpose of this was to create space to not only offer additional services, but to bring all services to the Great Lakes region. With innovation and efficiency in the vision, GLCS strives to be the one-stop shop for all of your civil needs. Under this new brand be assured that no matter the need, we are here to serve. https://g.page/r/CSTdnyjF5iQIEBE/review
